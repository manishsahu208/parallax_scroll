                <br>

                I am passionate about technology, innovation and big challenging tasks on my to-do list. That makes me
                want to learn more and keep up with building something greater than me.

                In terms of the work I am doing here at Bunnyshell, I am most passionate about the technologies that we
                are using. My tasks as a junior DevOps imply working with many bleeding-edge technologies. That involves
                going through lots of documentation and processes.

                Since I started this job here I also improved my research skills. Because I wanted to find more and more
                about how can I expand my knowledge.

            <p class="text">Engineers are people who solve problems and focus on making things work more efficiently and
                effectively. They apply the theories and principles of science and mathematics to research and develop
                economical solutions to technical problems. That is the definition of an Engineer. Agreed. But who are
                the engineering students? They are often the ones who are overburdened with their assignments, deprived
                of sleep, low on social life (maybe) and busy in their own world of sci-fi movies and series. In this
                article, we have tried to compile, in pictures, what all engineering students go through.

            <p class="text">In most reports setting forth frameworks or standards for science, technology, and
                engineering, the three domains are described as related by their focus on systems in the real world yet
                different in the roles that the disciplines play in understanding and modifying the world. The
                definitions for this entry are based on documents produced by national sets of experts in which the
                relationships of science, technology, and engineering are described. Definitions of science,
                engineering, and technology can be culled from these frameworks and standards developed by engineering
                and science organizations, as well as from standards for engineering and technology for state, national,
                and international assessments.

                <br>


                These definitions of science, technology, and engineering are the starting points for developing
                assessments of understanding of the ways in which they are related. This entry begins with a summary of
                prominent conceptualizations of science, technology, and engineering. The definitions...
